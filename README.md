# 🎮 Cirtagon

> **A path to real riches, led by riddles — see if you’re truly on the path… or just lost in a beautiful maze.**

**Cirtagon** is a minimalist puzzle game where logic meets mystery. Players must unlock a sequence of seven arcane seals. Each seal hides a unique riddle — and a reward. The deeper you go, the greater the prize.

No sign-ups. No tracking. No tricks. Just riddles and crypto — for those clever (and stubborn) enough to win.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Some parts of this project — including UI text and structural code — were generated or refined using AI tools to accelerate development.
> However, **all core puzzles, encryption mechanisms, were handcrafted manually** to ensure fairness, originality, and integrity.

## 🧠 Game Overview

Cirtagon offers a layered riddle-solving journey, where:

- 🧩 **Puzzles start simple** and grow more complex — logic, pattern, obsession required.
- 🗝️ **Each seal unlocks a reward**, starting at `10 USDT`, then `100`, then `1000`...
- 🪙 **The final treasure?** A **1,000,000 USDT encrypted wallet** awaits the one who solves them all.
- 🧭 **Each challenge is crafted to be fair** but unforgiving — only full decryption grants access.

> This is not just a game — it's a test of mind and persistence.  
> Can you decode your way to fortune?

## 🔐 How It Works

- No logins. No emails. No wallets needed to play.
- You solve a cipher. It reveals a **seed phrase** — the recovery key to a wallet preloaded with USDT.
- Once solved, **you own the wallet**. Change the recovery phrase and move the funds as you wish.
- All logic runs locally in your browser. Source code is public. There’s nothing hidden.

> The rewards are real. The challenge is real. The only lock is the cipher.

## 💡 Why the Gradual Rewards?

This game is **not a scam**, **not a phishing trap**, and **not an airdrop trick**.

The prize structure is **deliberately progressive**:  
- `10 USDT` proves that rewards are real.  
- `100 USDT` deepens the challenge.  
- `1000 USDT` tests serious solvers.  
- `1,000,000 USDT` — the encrypted final wallet — is for the best.

We want players to verify the integrity of the game **early**, without risk. If we ever ask you for personal data, email, wallet address, or anything beyond playing… **we're scammers. Call us out.**

This game is meant to be **a pure, open challenge for minds**, not a data harvest.

## 🔍 Hidden Truths

Each reward is more than just a prize — it's a step toward a final encrypted truth.

> **Look beyond the riddle. Think like a decoder.**
